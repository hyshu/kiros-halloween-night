# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a roguelike adventure game featuring Kiro, a ghost character who explores a vast world, encounters enemies, collects candy items, and navigates through obstacles to reach a final boss battle. The game will be built on top of the existing Flutter GPU 3D rendering system and will feature strategic gameplay elements including enemy interaction through candy gifts, trap detection, and dialogue systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Ghost Character Control

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control Kiro the ghost character so that I can navigate through the game world and interact with the environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player uses input controls THEN Kiro SHALL move in the corresponding direction on the grid
2. WHEN Kiro encounters a wall or obstacle THEN the system SHALL prevent movement through that tile
3. WHEN Kiro moves THEN the 3D ghost model (assets/graveyard/character-ghost.obj) SHALL be rendered at the new position
4. WHEN Kiro is idle THEN the system SHALL display appropriate idle animations or states

### Requirement 2: Large World Map Generation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to explore a vast world so that I can experience an epic adventure with varied terrain and challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL generate a 500 x 1000 tile map
2. WHEN generating the map THEN the system SHALL place walls and obstacles to create defined pathways
3. WHEN generating the map THEN the system SHALL ensure there is a navigable path from start to the boss location
4. WHEN the map is created THEN the system SHALL place the final boss monster at the end of the main path
5. WHEN the map is generated THEN the entire perimeter SHALL be surrounded by impassable walls or obstacles
6. WHEN the map boundaries are created THEN there SHALL be no gaps that allow characters to escape the play area

### Requirement 3: Enemy System with Proximity-Based Activity

**User Story:** As a player, I want to encounter enemies that react intelligently to my presence so that the game feels dynamic and performance is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enemies are spawned THEN the system SHALL use human and monster 3D models from the assets
2. WHEN Kiro is within a certain distance of an enemy THEN the enemy SHALL become active and potentially hostile
3. WHEN Kiro moves beyond the activation distance THEN the enemy SHALL become inactive to optimize performance
4. WHEN an enemy is active THEN it SHALL be able to move and interact according to its AI behavior
5. WHEN an enemy encounters a wall or obstacle THEN it SHALL not be able to pass through

### Requirement 4: Candy Item System with Abilities

**User Story:** As a player, I want to collect different types of candy items so that I can gain various abilities and interact strategically with enemies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map is generated THEN the system SHALL randomly place candy items using food 3D models from assets/foods
2. WHEN Kiro moves onto a tile with candy THEN the system SHALL add the candy to Kiro's inventory
3. WHEN candy is collected THEN the system SHALL apply the corresponding ability or effect to Kiro
4. WHEN different candy types are collected THEN each SHALL provide unique abilities or stat modifications
5. WHEN candy is in inventory THEN the player SHALL be able to view available candy items

### Requirement 5: Enemy Interaction Through Candy Gifts and Ally System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to give candy to enemies so that they become my allies and help me in combat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player chooses to give candy to an adjacent enemy THEN the system SHALL present available candy options
2. WHEN candy is given to an enemy THEN the enemy SHALL become Kiro's ally and follow Kiro
3. WHEN an enemy becomes an ally THEN it SHALL display satisfaction behavior and change to ally status
4. WHEN an ally is active THEN it SHALL move with Kiro and attack hostile enemies
5. WHEN candy is given THEN it SHALL be removed from Kiro's inventory

### Requirement 6: Ally Combat and Lifecycle System

**User Story:** As a player, I want my allied enemies to fight alongside me so that I can build a team and use strategic combat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hostile enemies encounter allied enemies THEN they SHALL attack the allies
2. WHEN allied enemies encounter hostile enemies THEN they SHALL attack the hostile enemies
3. WHEN an allied enemy takes damage THEN its health SHALL decrease accordingly
4. WHEN an allied enemy's health reaches zero THEN it SHALL become satisfied and disappear from the game
5. WHEN allies are fighting THEN the dialogue system SHALL provide combat feedback

### Requirement 7: Collision Detection and Movement Constraints

**User Story:** As a player, I want realistic movement limitations so that the game world feels solid and strategic positioning matters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro attempts to move into a wall tile THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement
2. WHEN Kiro attempts to move into an obstacle tile THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement
3. WHEN an enemy attempts to move into a wall or obstacle THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement
4. WHEN any character attempts invalid movement THEN the system SHALL maintain their current position
5. WHEN collision occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the player

### Requirement 8: Dialogue and Event System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see dialogue and event information so that I can understand the story and game events as they happen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL display relevant dialogue in a dialogue window
2. WHEN Kiro interacts with enemies THEN appropriate dialogue SHALL be shown
3. WHEN items are collected THEN descriptive text SHALL appear in the dialogue system
4. WHEN story events trigger THEN the system SHALL display narrative text
5. WHEN dialogue is active THEN the player SHALL be able to advance or dismiss the dialogue

### Requirement 9: Boss Battle System

4. WHEN the boss is defeated THEN the game SHALL provide victory conditions and feedback
5. WHEN the boss battle is active THEN the dialogue system SHALL provide battle-specific information

### Requirement 10: 3D Rendering Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see all game elements rendered in 3D so that the game is visually engaging and uses the existing rendering system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game object is displayed THEN it SHALL use the appropriate 3D model from the assets folder
2. WHEN the camera system is active THEN it SHALL provide a good view of the game action
3. WHEN multiple objects are on screen THEN the rendering system SHALL handle them efficiently
4. WHEN the game runs THEN it SHALL maintain smooth performance using the existing Flutter GPU system
